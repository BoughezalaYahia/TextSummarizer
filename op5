Global warming is an increase in the average temperature of the earth’s temperature, especially a sustained change sufficient to cause climate change.This increase in earth’s average temperature is called Global warming.into the atmosphere.The major source of carbon dioxide is the power plants.About twenty percent of carbon dioxide emitted in the atmosphere comes from burning of gasoline in the engines of the vehicles.Buildings, both commercial and residential represent a larger source of global warming pollution than cars and trucks.Building of these structures require a lot of fuel to be burnt which emits a large amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Methane is more than 20 times as effectual as C02 at entrapping heat in the atmosphere.Methane is obtained from resources such as rice paddies, bovine flatulence, bacteria in bogs and fossil fuel manufacture.The effect of global warming is increasing the average temperature of the earth.As an effect of global warming, many species of birds and animals have already become extinct.As an effect of global warming various new diseases have emerged lately.The global warming is expected to cause irreversible changes in the ecosystem and the behaviour of animals.Birds are a species that will be affected by a change in the climate.6 and 5.1 on the Richter scale.This ice would be enough to raise sea level 20 feet worldwide if it broke up and slipped into the sea.Many efforts are being made by various nations to cut down the rate of global warming.Also, many non profit organisations are working for the cause.A1 Gore was one of the foremost U.S. politicians to heave an alarm about the hazards of global warming.A1 Gore, has given various speeches to raise an awareness of global warming.He has warned people about the ill effects of Global warming and its remedies.The future of emissions damage depends on several factors, demographics, economics, technology, policies and institutional developments.Future predictions do not look good for this planet if nothing is done soon.
