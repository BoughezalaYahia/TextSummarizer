The reasons why accurate referencing is essential for academic work are not immediately apparent, particularly for students new to higher education.’ There are three main reasons for referencing.Firstly, referencing helps student writers to construct, structure, support and communicate arguments.Secondly, references link the writer’s work to the existing body of knowledge.Thirdly, only through referencing can academic work gain credibility.Becker (1986) believes the construction of arguments is the most important function of referencing systems.There are four dimensions to this.When the argument has been constructed, it needs academic support – and only references can provide this required support.Referencing also enables writers to communicate their arguments efficiently.Neville (2007, p.Immanuel Kant said “Science is organized knowledge”.This is the most fundamental reason for referencing from a theoretical point of view...29-30).The writer’s references are links to this network of knowledge.A writer needs to show how his or her work relates to current research and debates in their chosen subject area.This is one of the five principles of referencing identified by Walker and Taylor (2006).9-10), which leads to the next point.In the global academic community a more-cited article will find more recognition.However, this practice is not without its critics.186).Thompson calls this “ritualized obedience to the reigning authorities” (2003, p.27).So the important issue here is not about selecting references for their expediency value, but for their enduring quality.This brings us to the next point: credibility.” Correct referencing enables, therefore, the reader to check sources and verify conclusions.The issue of credibility is identified by commentators as a key issue in referencing...] your credibility as an author” (2008, p.177).10).The quality of references is, therefore, extremely important for the credibility of an academic work.Only a credible work that takes all important arguments into account will find acceptance in the academic world.So what is the point of referencing?
