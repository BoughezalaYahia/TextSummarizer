Scripting is "the precise specification of actions to be taken by service staff, in particular situations" (Clark & Johnston, 2008, p.251) and is an essential technique for managing in today’s globalized service environment.Second, this essay will examine the organisation ‘Equip’ and investigate how scripting is used.Using real examples of scripting at Equip it is possible to analyse the disadvantages and advantages of this technique.The term, ‘script’ is a "commonly used tool to design and manage the encounter between frontline service employees and customers" (Victorino, Verma & Wardell, 2008, p.2003).The use of scripting in service organisations aims to ensure a consistent level of service quality by creating procedures that assist employees in their daily tasks (Clark & Johnston, 2008).These procedures are typically a "predetermined set of specific words, phrases, and gestures, as well as other expectations for the employee to use during each step of the service process" (Victorino et al, p.6).Equip, an Australian-owned organisation, is chain of affordable jewellery stores, targeting females of all ages.EquipYourself Online claim "join our fast growing team ..working in a fun, young team environment’.Scholosser (2002) suggests the word ‘young’ used in the context of a service workforce often indicates an underlying belief that younger staff will be more flexible and conform to specific organisational procedures.This certainly appeared to be the case in the store where I worked, from the period of November 2010 till May 2011.There are ‘six steps’ to Equip's encounter script which guides the daily operations of its staff.The third step determines the customer's wants and needs.The employee is required to ask whether they wear gold or silver, or ask "what in particular are you looking for today"?The employee should  then encourage the customer to touch the additional piece of jewellery to persuade the customer it is the right thing to do.Touching merchandise increases the likelihood of sales (Underhill, 2008).This step is explained in more detail below.The final stage of the encounter is closing the sale which involves putting the item(s) through the PlatyPOS transaction system, placing the item in an Equip bag, and fare-welling the customer with a statement that will welcome them back again, such as ‘See you later!In addition to scripting answering the phone, scripting in Equip also extend to telling  employees where they are to be positioned in store, and what to expect and say in each of the areas they are responsible for.Equip is successful in that they have avoided heavy amounts of scripting in a rather customised service delivery.This plays to Equips advantage as customers tend to take a dim view of heavy scripting.Scripting is incorporated into Equips’ operations due to the vast advantages for their employees, customers and the organisation as a whole.With a clear set of rules and guidelines in place, employees are able to work more effectively as they have a clear understanding of their responsibilities and role (Johnston & Clark, 2008).This creates an environment with minimal stress and a "sense of security to behaviour" (Johnston & Clark, 2008, p.The employee's overall anxiety is reduced.Thus, customers anticipate the type of question that will be asked and this reduces the overall pressure they may feel as there "exists a good understanding of what will happen and what is required of the customer at each stage" (Johnston & Clark, 2008, p.253).As Chase and Dasu (2001, p.84) state "ultimately, only one thing matters in a service encounter—the customer’s perceptions of what occurred".Further, according to Tansik and Smith’s (2000) ‘functions for using scripting’, a main advantage of this technique is being able to accurately diagnose customers’ needs and wants.Equip needs this information in order to operationalize their brand values: they state this purpose in strong language: "…our complete devotion to help customers find that sought after latest accessory is what will continue to make the Equip brand so successful" (Equip Online, 2010).Nevertheless it must be acknowledged that there can be a tension between 'service' and 'sales', and it can be difficult to get the balance right between serving the customer and making sure their needs and wants are met, and on-selling to them in a way that they do not find overly aggressive and pushy.Equip employees who base their interactions on the ‘six steps’ are advantaged if they use the steps along with an upbeat personality to encourage and subconsciously manipulate customers into purchasing jewelry item(s) the customer believes they ‘need’.Therefore, this increases the chance that the customer will ‘add on’ to the jewelry they have already chosen, or make the customer more inclined to purchase at all.Employees’ that successfully achieve target objections, which means having  more than 45% multi sales, are rewarded with material goods, such as movie tickets and body wash.However, employees can only succeed with multi sales if they create a positive and enjoyable service experience for the customer, and if their interactions do not feel false and inauthentic (Ashforth & Tomiuk, 2000).Employees can use the script to enhance the customer's experience and this adds value for them, which increases the profit that Equip can make, and can lead to rewards for the employee.Step Five requires the employee to handle any objections effectively.She refused to drive to the other store to do the exchange as asked by the employee.Thus, by positively engaging the customer through service recovery the customer, who was more than happy to exchange the item, then also purchased additional items.Therefore, by enacting Step Five well, Equip benefited as this ultimately lead to multiple items being sold.Although Equip is growing in profit and claim that their brand’s success is due to their devotion to "help customers find that sought after latest accessory" (Equip Online, 2010) the use of scripting to achieve this is not entirely flawless, and does have its drawbacks if not approached in an appropriate manner.Again, from  my personal experience, mystery shopping, which is regularly used to assess quality at Equip, can backfire and actually cause poor performance.In one case where a mystery shop was conducted the result sheet was faxed to our Equip store.The report detailed how one identifiable employee had not met the six steps precisely.The employee consequently failed the test with comments of too much deviation from the ‘six steps’.This resulted in the employee adopting a heavier approach to scripting, as she conformed exactly to the criteria of the ‘six steps’.According to Johnston and Clark (2008) this is likely due to customers’ perception of ‘robot-like behaviour’.Greeting a customer within 30 seconds and initiating the six steps may be viewed as too interrogative, and viewed as ‘going through the motions’ of service delivery without any real sincerity (Lawrence & Weber, 2010).During the busy shopping day periods these are appropriate targets.However, during quiet periods requirements to meet 45% multi sales can act as an organisational pressure for employees, resulting in unnecessary stress, and potentially requiring a more forceful service delivery and therefore a more unpleasant service experience for the customer (and the employee), and a feeling of constant competition between employees to ‘get a sale’.Overall, this essay confirms that scripting is a vital technique for managing service people and processes.By briefly outlining the nature of scripting it is evident that it is indeed used in Equips’ management strategy.This organisation further benefits from the technique through accurately diagnosing customers’ needs and wants and controlling the customer to an extent.Generally, at Equip in my experience, scripting does not offset the autonomy of either the customer or employee to the extent where the service experience is unpleasant.
