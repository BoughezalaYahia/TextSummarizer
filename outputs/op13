By the time I reached my late 20s, I was desperately looking for a way out of Beijing.Every bus route had to be redirected.Every building was covered in scaffolding.Living there had become a visual and logistical torture.For me, as a writer and film-maker, it was also becoming impossible artistically, with increasing restraints placed on my work.I heard that the Chevening scholarship and the British Council were looking for talent in China.I had never heard of Chevening.The wealthy housewives of Beijing in particular loved the fancy houses and rich people dressed in elegant costumes riding about on white horses.So I applied as a film-maker.“Congratulations!You are one of three people in China this year who’ve won the scholarship!She also handed me back my passport with a UK visa in it.” my mother said.“All your years of studying now make sense”.”  “Yes.Greater than United States, right?” my mother said, drawing her conclusions from her Maoist education of the 1960s.“You should take a rice cooker with you.It was 1 April, and the Beijing sandstorm season had begun.I dragged my luggage towards the subway, choking in the sandy soup.“I will be walking under a gentle and moist English sky soon,” I said to myself.All this was destined to be nothing more than a memory.When I arrived at Heathrow, there was no one to pick me up, and all I had was a reservation letter for a student hostel near Marylebone station in central London.The air clung to my cheeks.Everything felt threatening: the policemen moving about the street corner with their hands resting on their truncheons, long queues of grey-faced people at bus stops but no one talking, fire engines shooting through the traffic with howling sirens.I realised that I knew nothing about this country at all.And, most of all, my only tool of communication was a jumble of half-grammatically-correct sentences.In China I had learned that the population of Britain was equal to that of my little province, Zhejiang.Still, here I was.As the Chinese say, ruxiang suisu – once in the village, you must follow their customs.This was impossible in my home country.But I was also blindly looking for something connected to the west, something non-ideological, something imaginative and romantic.Instead, I was faced with a world of practical problems and difficulties.Perhaps I was looking for great writers to meet or great books to read, but I could barely decipher a paragraph of English.But all I encountered were angry teenagers who screamed at me as they passed on their stolen bikes and grabbed my bag – they were the most frightening group I had ever met in my life.Before I came to England, I thought all British teenagers attended elite boarding schools such as Eton, spoke posh and wore perfect black suits.In the evenings, I hid my long hair in my coat and walked along the graffiti-smeared streets and piss-drenched alleyways, passing beggars with their dogs, and I asked myself: “So is this what the rich west is really like?” If that was the case, I wanted to cry.What an idiot I was.Now I realised there had been some truth to my own country’s communist education: the west was not milk and honey.I felt like a complete alien in Beaconsfield.I was told that this was the richest village in all of Britain.Here, every home was surrounded by trimmed rose bushes – yellow roses in the front garden, red in the back.And everyone seemed to own a pair of cars, parked alongside their house.Instead, a car factory lay on the outskirts, alongside warehouses with trucks delivering goods to Waitrose or Sainsbury’s.Most students commuted from London, so I was a rarity in Beaconsfield.The only place with an open door was a brightly lit pub called the Old Swan, where I used to spend my afternoons.I liked English pubs because they had a particular smell that reminded me of my mother’s silk factory in Wenling, with its heavy scent of steam, stale air, human sweat and scorched protein.The woman behind the counter began to take this as a sort of weird insult, knowing that I would be sitting in the corner for hours.After a few visits with my books and laptop, everyone started calling me Lucy.“So how are your parents in Hong Kong?” I was so confused.Apparently she had the same long, black hair as mine.They were so sure that I was Lucy from Hong Kong that I didn’t want to correct them.“I thought you went back to Hong Kong!“I remember your dad visited you a while back, and he was very fond of our lager.Is he still working for HSBC?I guessed that was a plausible answer to her question.My previous training in China was, I quickly discovered, the enemy of the style here.The film-makers I had loved intensely when I was in Beijing such as Dziga Vertov, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Jean-Luc Godard, Chantal Akerman, Chris Marker and Jean Rouch were considered old-fashioned artists – they belonged only to European cinema.Of course, I felt their judgment was unfair.But I didn’t want to get into such an argument with the students and teachers, because my English was too limited to say what I wanted.Instead, I spent most of my time alone in the Old Swan, studying English grammar and reading an English dictionary straight from the letter A.  During those desolate days, I thought a lot about my childhood.Identity seemed to be purely a construction – something I had only just realised.A feeling of being a “second-class citizen” dominated my every day in Beaconsfield, and made me hang my head in despair.Originally I thought I would live in Beaconsfield so that I could save time commuting between London and the film school.So I moved out of my shared flat and headed to London.It was simpler than I thought – a 40-minute train ride.Here I was, walking among all the other non-English speaking foreigners.Bengalis, Arabs, Brazilians, Spanish, Germans, French, Italians, Vietnamese and even Icelanders!In London, I lived first in a stingy, sad little house along a railway line by Tottenham Hale station.Later I moved to a flat on a council estate on Hackney Road that felt like a prison.My English wasn’t good enough to go through a page of text before I was so completely frustrated by my constant checking of the dictionary.There was no one to talk to.You might hear a police car rushing past, blasting its siren at a deafening volume.Under some dim street light, an old homeless person would be slumped on a bench pulling a newspaper over himself for shelter; then a glass bottle would be smashed against a wall, followed by a chorus of swearing.How did its people live here for years on end?I hadn’t spent much time in the happier parts of this great capital, the “posh” areas.Only the ivy that grew along the rusty fences didn’t notice the brutality of this side of London.The year I came to England, I was nearing 30.It was actually the first birthday party I had organised in my entire life.Like most Chinese families at the time, mine never celebrated birthdays.Everyone declared that 30 was a good age, the age at which you started to know yourself a little, when you were no longer confused and started achieving goals.But I spent that year very confused.At the end of the Chevening scholarship I was supposed to go back to China.Now the crucial question was: how do I make a living in the west?I had to survive somehow.I could only see myself making a living through writing, as I had done in China.By the time my 30th birthday party drew to a close, I was clear about my direction: I would have to start writing in another tongue.I would use my broken English, even though it would be extremely difficult.I would make an advantage out of my disadvantage.The novel would be a sort of phrasebook, recording the things she did and the people she met.I had to overcome the huge obstacle of my poor English.Perhaps this was a huge mistake?In Chinese, most characters are drawn and composed from images.Calligraphy is one of the foundations of the written language.So “extreme yang” can only mean the sun.Visual imagination and philosophical understandings were useless when it came to European languages.Technically, the foremost difficulty for an Asian writer who wants to write in English is tense.All tenses are in the present, because once you say something, you mean it in your current time and space.Take the verb “to go”.In Chinese it is 走, zou, and you can use zou in any context without needing to change it.Mastering conjugations was a serious struggle for me, almost a dialectical critique of the metaphysics of grammar.I particularly detested the past-perfect progressive tense, which I called the Annoying PPP: a continuous action completed at some point in the past.My immediate reaction, even before I got to the grammatical explanation, was: my God, how could someone paint his house for weeks and still give up?I just couldn’t see how time itself could regulate people’s actions as if they were little clocks!They were bizarre decorations that did nothing but obscure a simple, strong building.My instinct was to say something like: “Peter tries to paint his house, but sadness overwhelms him, causing him to lay down his brushes and give up his dream”.They couldn’t understand who this “we” was referring to.Instead, I should have said “We Chinese like to eat rice”.But it made me uncomfortable.After all, how could someone who had grown up in a collective society get used to using the first-person singular all the time?But here, in this foreign country, I had to build a world as a first-person singular – urgently.Still, the desire and will to work on a first book in English propelled me through the difficulties.The diary became the raw material for my novel, the one I had imagined while mopping the floor after my 30th birthday party: A Concise Chinese–English Dictionary for Lovers.
