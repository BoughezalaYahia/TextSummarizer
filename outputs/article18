The Traditional costing practices were pressurised by Cooper & Kaplan, (1984) due to the failure of providing detailed and quality information for decision making.Practically, there is a continuum between these two methods in a firm using them (Antos & Brimson, 1999).This paper is structured into three sections.The first section deals with the publication released on ABC costing since its inception to the present date.The second section assesses the impact of ABC studies on the companies and consultants.The third section provides the conclusion.The relevant case study is also presented to provide the evidence of Researches.Initially, it was only a response by American scholars over incorrect standard costing methods.Lebas (1991) agreed that ABC has gained strategic and management dimensions.Under a firm, a SMA tool has the ability to link the strategic & marketing goals with the operational goals.These criticisms includes the costly implementation of ABC, greater time utilisation and difficult to define the cost drivers.It also provides cost information for making timely decisions and follows more closely the trail of the indirect costs and the cost object.A recent study by Rodriguez (2010), review thoroughly the existing empirical evidence internationally, about the process of ABC system implementation.• The implementation of various international ABC models is examined through surveys, tablets or in-depth case study of the process implementation in different private companies & economic sectors whose information is analysed by multiple regression models.ABC designs are based on experiments and statistical system of the results.For example, the application of the processes of continual improvement to optimise the use of scarce resources of an organisation.The company operations includes the design, development and production of materials bearings, brake fluid and coolant, rivets tooling to install and auto friction materials parties.The company belongs to the metal industry mechanics and is classified within the ISIC 3430: manufacture of parts and accessories for vehicles and their engines.Certification has earned him and strengthen the recognition and confidence to their local customers and from outside.To develop the case study selected and coasted production processes and supporting steps to generate the ABC system, taking into account each of the elements involved are: • Gather all costs and expenses of the company under the concept of resource pool.Next, resources are typified into three categories: materials then, direct staff and other resources.• Select the cost objects: production activities and product liners clutch.If the answer is yes, then charged directly to the product.As an illustrative we can mention that the costs of materials are charged directly to the lining of clutch.• If the answer to the question in third point is negative, then it is necessary to develop inproducers of resources to allocate the cost resources to activities.A Budget can be described as a standard or a plan in financial terms.The budgets are prepared in order to control and measure the actual performance with the planned.Once the total activity cost is determined than drivers can be assigned which connects the primary activities with the support activities of the organisation.Flexibility can be introduced in the labour force such as labour deployed according to the need, hidden cost and waste can be eliminated, considering the least and most expensive activities, places can be identified where spending can be reduced and cost baseline could be established through the introduction of technology and process which limits the efforts requirements in the activity (Vercio, 2011).Strategic control and planning have become essential requirement due to the rising completion and variation in consumer demands.It further provides information regarding enhancement of production process, customer profitability analyses and pricing decision.The ABC has generated enormous enthusiasm in and around its basic ideas.Moreover, researchers are studying the actual cost accounting practices of companies.The ABC system is the most developed and expensive attempt done so far to identify and correlation that causes (cost drivers) and activities.Therefore, we can say that this new costing method have based their criticism of the traditional costing that they were always using labour as a basis for application apportionments.Accounting costs highlights the interdependent activities and trends between activities in many departments or functional areas.The Activity-Based Management is not the excellent way to respond to the cost-generating activity, which is true;similarly, an appropriate direction needs not to have an accurate assessment of each functional area and through the resources required to implement it.Many scholars and consultants have never tended to explore the history of thought.However, if they do, avoid leaning their versions of the history.If they do, should be especially careful to avoid claiming that their ideas are new.Such simplified ignores other sources of information; other factors influence the pricing and numerous interdependencies and points between products and costs.Apart from a dependable data collection technique, it also trains the employees regarding ABC and activity-based management.More importantly, it also assures the achievement of the project by supporting in constructing a feeling of possession among the employees.Therefore, it is essential that the interviewer who might be a consultant from outside the company or is a member of the project team.At the same time some scholars ignore the difficulties presented by such a method, which are neither few nor simple to solve.It is therefore inevitable to refer to the confusion causing the fact that a book with such misunderstanding of what are the costs has dissemination has been achieved e.g.even claims that the traditional methods "as all they do is give distorted information nothing wrong late and cannot thus making decisions.This author goes on to say, From indeed, if top management is unaware of his obsolescence, then it runs a serious risk of wrong decisions and follow product strategies that can be wrong fatal consequences.The same is true in the case of throughput accounting in which only the raw material is considered as Cost, and labor and charges indirect and overhead costs that take results (Zimmerman, 1997).Apart from that already given in the previous note, this change from the traditional method does not involve talk of a new method.Furthermore, it is also arguable that labour is always considered a fixed cost, as their organisations in which the item is still functional of manufacture and, therefore, it is clearly Variable mind, the typical case would be the.As regards the mathematical model invented by the author of the text, it is only a suggestion to reduce costs, which does not mean, either, which is a cost method.With regard to the concepts Chain value and product life cycle, although interesting topics to include methods costing should not be considered as such because not imply a change in assignments or new application databases, or that there are elements different cost, etc., features that do includes the ABC.
