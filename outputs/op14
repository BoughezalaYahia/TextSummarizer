Scripting is "the precise specification of actions to be taken by service staff, in particular situations" (Clark & Johnston, 2008, p.251) and is an essential technique for managing in today’s globalized service environment.This essay will first briefly outline the nature of scripting.Second, this essay will examine the organisation ‘Equip’ and investigate how scripting is used.36).2003).Scripting is also defined as a "design tool used to exert a degree of control over employee-customer interactions that may take place where there is no direct supervision or oversight" (Tansik & Smith, 1991, p.36).6).Equip, an Australian-owned organisation, is chain of affordable jewellery stores, targeting females of all ages.EquipYourself Online claim "join our fast growing team ...working in a fun, young team environment’.Many organisations, Equip included, not only hire young workers that can relate to their predominantly young customers, but also hire young people as they are assumed to be more compliant.Scholosser (2002) suggests the word ‘young’ used in the context of a service workforce often indicates an underlying belief that younger staff will be more flexible and conform to specific organisational procedures.This certainly appeared to be the case in the store where I worked, from the period of November 2010 till May 2011.There are ‘six steps’ to Equip's encounter script which guides the daily operations of its staff.The third step determines the customer's wants and needs.The employee is required to ask whether they wear gold or silver, or ask "what in particular are you looking for today"?The employee must then suggest an ‘add on’: for example the matching bracelet to the necklace they have chosen.Touching merchandise increases the likelihood of sales (Underhill, 2008).This step is explained in more detail below.The final stage of the encounter is closing the sale which involves putting the item(s) through the PlatyPOS transaction system, placing the item in an Equip bag, and fare-welling the customer with a statement that will welcome them back again, such as ‘See you later!From my personal experience the phone has to be answered in a specific way with an initial warm welcome, stating the organisation and store location, and who is speaking.This stance towards scripting is encouraged by  management.With a clear set of rules and guidelines in place, employees are able to work more effectively as they have a clear understanding of their responsibilities and role (Johnston & Clark, 2008).Consequently a consistent, smooth work flow is generally established (Dilworth, 1986).This creates an environment with minimal stress and a "sense of security to behaviour" (Johnston & Clark, 2008, p.251) for both the customer and the employee.The employee's overall anxiety is reduced.Thus, customers anticipate the type of question that will be asked and this reduces the overall pressure they may feel as there "exists a good understanding of what will happen and what is required of the customer at each stage" (Johnston & Clark, 2008, p.253).As Chase and Dasu (2001, p.84) state "ultimately, only one thing matters in a service encounter—the customer’s perceptions of what occurred".Further, according to Tansik and Smith’s (2000) ‘functions for using scripting’, a main advantage of this technique is being able to accurately diagnose customers’ needs and wants.Equip needs this information in order to operationalize their brand values: they state this purpose in strong language: "…our complete devotion to help customers find that sought after latest accessory is what will continue to make the Equip brand so successful" (Equip Online, 2010).Nevertheless it must be acknowledged that there can be a tension between 'service' and 'sales', and it can be difficult to get the balance right between serving the customer and making sure their needs and wants are met, and on-selling to them in a way that they do not find overly aggressive and pushy.Control is a major purpose of scripting (Tansik & Smith, 2000).Using an opening line such as "what a nice dress you have, where did you get it from"?Therefore, this increases the chance that the customer will ‘add on’ to the jewelry they have already chosen, or make the customer more inclined to purchase at all.Employees’ that successfully achieve target objections, which means having  more than 45% multi sales, are rewarded with material goods, such as movie tickets and body wash.For an example from my own personal experience, a customer wanted an exchange for the same handbag in another colour.The Equip store where I worked did not have the colour she wanted in stock, and only Equip at another outlet did.She refused to drive to the other store to do the exchange as asked by the employee.This suited the customer and this assistance actually exceeded her expectations.Thus, by positively engaging the customer through service recovery the customer, who was more than happy to exchange the item, then also purchased additional items.Therefore, by enacting Step Five well, Equip benefited as this ultimately lead to multiple items being sold.This process helped retain the customer, and so overall the process may provide a higher customer lifetime value resulting in an overall growth in profits (Samson & Daft, 2005).Again, from  my personal experience, mystery shopping, which is regularly used to assess quality at Equip, can backfire and actually cause poor performance.Mystery shoppers might assess an Equip store every 2 months to ‘monitor employees’ adherence to organisational scripts (Scharf, 2003).In one case where a mystery shop was conducted the result sheet was faxed to our Equip store.The report detailed how one identifiable employee had not met the six steps precisely.The employee consequently failed the test with comments of too much deviation from the ‘six steps’.Consequently, the employee’s multi sales dropped below the target of 45%.According to Johnston and Clark (2008) this is likely due to customers’ perception of ‘robot-like behaviour’.Each employee is sometimes given targets for each day depending on the hours they will work.During the busy shopping day periods these are appropriate targets.This can lead to poor morale and high staff attrition rates.
