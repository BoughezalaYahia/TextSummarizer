Even before he arrived at the accident scene, sergeant Matt Smith knew it would be bad.He knew from experience that there was a fundamental truth about car wrecks: drivers have a pretty good chance of surviving a crash that’s car versus car, but they rarely walk away from a vehicle that’s slammed into a tree.Smith’s hunch proved true.When he arrived, he found a white Toyota Hilux pickup wrapped around a gum tree as thick as a sumo wrestler.By some miracle bystanders had found a dog, an aging bichon frise, inside the truck, dazed but alive.But the driver had no chance.Officers traced the registration to Dennis “Lee” Lafferty, age 75.Everybody knew Lee.Or at least knew of him.He was on medication for his Parkinson’s disease and prone to nodding off at any moment.In the coming days, newspapers ran stories about the “local tourism stalwart” who “did not have a bad bone in his body”.There was a packed memorial service.And then everyone but Lee’s family began to move on.Smith was intrigued.Sergeant Smith isn’t the sort of person who is ­easily surprised or impressed.He once walked into a house that a spurned husband had ­booby-trapped with a ­speargun and ­barely flinched.Following a 2008 ­cyclone, he chased after a seven-­foot-long croco­dile gliding up a Mossman road.He has responded to multiple heli­copter crashes in the area.The west coast of Florida is an ­angler’s paradise.Back in the 1960s, elite fishermen were treated like rock stars.They were ­invited to cocktail parties, and their exploits were chronicled in the newspapers.Legend has it he once single-handedly brought up a 90-foot barge that had sunk in 100-foot waters using only scuba gear and inflatable tubes.He once caught more than 2,000 pounds of grouper in a single weekend.All this despite the fact that he was blind in his left eye, a consequence of being struck in the face with a broom as he and a friend swept the cafeteria floor in middle school.He’d been raised in a modest house in Saint Petersburg, the son of a commercial fisherman and a Sunday school teacher.His renegade spirit and affinity for the outdoors emerged early in life.As a teenager, incensed over the degradation of Florida’s wetlands, he boasted of sinking a massive dredge operating out of Tampa Bay.He was hired by Clint Murchison Jr., the ­founder of the Dallas Cowboys, to pilot Murchison’s shimmering 40-foot Miss Centex in 1965.By the late 1960s, though, the Murchison gig had ended.He tried to compensate for lean times by running stone crab traps in winter.“You work your fanny off.You pay your taxes.You make a living.And that’s it”.There’s some disagreement as to how and when he was first drawn into smuggling.Wherever the truth lies, Stansel’s pot-smuggling enterprise was booming by the early 1970s.Marijuana was harder to come by in the U.S. in those days, a consequence of President Richard Nixon’s effort to shut off the flow from Mexico.But in Jamaica, buying a few ounces was as easy as buying a piece of fruit.The marijuana was grown deep in the hills by villagers, who sold their product in 50-pound burlap sacks.Making connections was easy; transporting it back to the States—where it could sell for $175 a pound, a profit of $165—posed a challenge.He soon expanded his operations into Colombia, which produced the most prized pot on the planet, by forming a partnership with a major supplier named Raul “Black Tuna” Davila-Jimeno.(In just two operations in 1974, they reportedly seized more than 200,000 pounds.“We trusted each ­other.“We were a pretty close-knit group.Sailing off the beach, jumping waves, surfing, ­Jimmy ­Buffett.For a while, he stacked $100 bills in orange crates in his parents’ attic.He opened a bank account in the Cayman Islands, bought gold bars in Costa Rica, and set up seafood and boat-­building companies in Panama and Honduras.He also bought something he’d need to expand his operation: more boats.Striding toward the parking lot with a brown briefcase in his hand, he ­blended in easily with the hotel’s well-heeled clientele.He folded his lanky frame into the driver’s seat of an Avis rental car, keyed the ignition, and turned north on Sunshine Skyway.Seconds later a group of unmarked police cars pulled out behind him.Just after he turned off the highway, police radios crackled with news: a statewide grand jury had issued an indictment against him and three of his partners for conspiracy to possess marijuana.They jumped out of their cars, ordered him to exit his ­vehicle, and cuffed him without incident.In his pockets he had $5,476 in cash.The case against him was already strong—the cops had flipped several of his associates.He was booked on a $1 million bond.At a marathon three-day hearing, his lawyer, a federal prosecutor turned private attorney named Bernard Dempsey Jr., convinced a judge to lower it to $500,000.It was, at the time, the largest bond ever posted in Florida history.The trial opened on a gloomy Monday in January 1975, and it promised to be a full-blown media spectacle.“For a Water­gate-fed public still hungry for a big, juicy trial, today there is—Raymond Grady Stansel,” read an article that appeared that morning in the St. Petersburg Times.J.” Salcines.Salcines was ­supremely confident.Salcines seethed.He demanded proof of Stansel’s fate.“We insist not on any foreign documents,” Salcines shouted.“We want the body—dead or alive”.The tips that came in over the subsequent weeks, months, and years were dizzying.“That man had been on the water his whole life.He was like a fish”.The agency released a bulletin announcing his capture, and the news spread rapidly through Florida.Wherever he was, investigators were fairly certain he wasn’t alone.(He and Midge were estranged by then, and Stansel’s kids were used to seeing him with other women.When I finally heard from her ten months ­later, she made it politely clear that she wasn’t interested in speaking to reporters.“I have been offered money and the proverbial 15 minutes of fame (infamy?) and I was and am not interested,” she wrote in an e-mail from her home in Australia.She added that she was wary of how the couple might be portrayed.“We are never so uncomplicated as presented by the media with their limited space and time”.If the story was ­going to be told, she realized that it wouldn’t serve the man she had loved to stay silent.“They may not be perfect human beings their whole lives, but there are individuals that make quite an ­impression on the ­planet,” she said.As he crossed a bridge, he lost his tail, “dodging here, dodging there,” according to Janet.Then he made a dash to a local airstrip, where a friend waited with a private plane.He somehow made it to Honduras—after all, he’d been smuggling drugs through the Gulf of Mexico for years.(In fact, the police had kept it after his arrest.During Christmas week, his four kids—all between the ages of 11 and 16—joined them there.Ray and Janet, meanwhile, split ways en route to a predetermined location in Guatemala City.The plan was to sail across the globe in their 40-foot boat.The goal: end up as close as possible to the Great Barrier Reef.They sailed to Belize, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Aruba, Curaçao, and Bonaire.They went on motorcycle treks through Central American mountain ranges.She sus­pected seasickness, but in Bonaire they learned that she was pregnant.Sailing around the world no longer seemed so appealing, so they decided to fly instead.“I do not say this to dismiss a few hard-­working professionals, but their devotion to duty can’t compare to devotion to a dream of life, love, and freedom”.There’s a saying in Australia’s Far North Queensland region: Your history starts here.For decades this remote stretch of pristine beaches and lush rainforest along the continent’s northeastern edge has attracted an oddball mix of Australian hippies and ­starry-eyed foreigners seeking a fresh start.You could be a German count or a renegade chemist who supplied LSD to the Grateful Dead.In the 1970s, there were no traffic lights and few paved roads.Despite its proxi­mity to the Great Barrier Reef, only the most determined travelers ever reached the area.Those who did often stopped in Port Douglas, a sleepy fishing village with a crescent-moon-shaped slice of golden beach.The downtown had a general store, a post office, and a couple of pubs where barefooted locals with names like Pegleg Tommy spun tales of bull sharks seen and giant crocs narrowly avoided.“The police?The lanky man who stepped out of the car identified himself as Dennis “Lee” Lafferty.If anyone asked—and few ever did—he was a fisherman from Texas.His wife was ­Janet Lafferty.If anyone asked—and few ever did—she came from Michigan, and both her parents were dead.It wasn’t just Australia’s far-off ­location and proximity to the reef that ­attracted the couple.Lafferty’s great-uncle had ­visited in the 1920s and described Far North Queensland as a real-life Shangri-La.It also offered an added benefit: the fishing was world-class.“We started from the get-go,” recalled Janet, who acted as Lee’s second mate as he relaunched his career.The waters off Port Douglas were so well stocked, fishermen needed nothing more than a rudimentary lure made out of a four-inch piece of curved metal with a hook ­attached to have success.It was almost comically primitive.“When was the last time a fish saw a school of spoons going by?“ ‘He’ll fish you out ten to one.“They didn’t go out and entertain.They lived a very modest life”.He struck me as just a normal worker”.In 1982, the Laffertys purchased an overgrown piece of property along the Daintree River’s southern bank.The 80-mile-long waterway snakes through dense rainforest, where you can walk for miles without ­encountering another human being.It’s the kind of place that would have obvious appeal to an international fugitive.The area has always been an ecological wonder, boasting unique species of mangrove trees, bats, birds, frogs, and tree kangaroos.He founded a company focused on exposing people to the best of it.We both learned that very quickly”.He talked to the indigenous population to learn how they used seeds and plants.As Lee’s ­understanding of the region’s ecosystem deepened, he dedicated himself to protecting it.He urged farmers to plant vegetation along the river’s edge to stop erosion.He pushed boaters to reduce their speed on the water so that the wake wouldn’t ­undercut the banks and disturb the microbes that ­inhabit the shallow areas.People close to him estimate that he saved the lives of hundreds of fruit bats that got stuck in the barbed-wire fences used by farmers.“Everybody here hates fruit bats, because they eat crops and spread disease,” said Lydia Archer, a longtime family friend.“He’d say they’re the most essential part of the ecosystem, because they spread native seeds throughout the forest”.Michael McGoldrick, real name Peyton Eidson, was the leader of a California smuggling ring and went on the run in the mid-1980s.Eidson and his wife and daughter had fled to Australia, where they operated a luxury mountain retreat.For weeks the story was the talk of the Cruise Centre.It seemed everyone had something to say—except Lee.As careful as they were, the secret still found its way outside the family.When Kianna and Jessie were teens, they took equestrian lessons from a future Olympian named Christine Doan.The relationship soured, and so did the Doan family’s feelings about the Laffertys.But the noose was beginning to tighten.Morgan was used to getting tips about Stansel; she was a 74-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner who had written numerous stories about him and other smugglers.Parkinson’s disease had sapped his strength and stiffened his body.His hands shook, making it difficult for him to hold a coffee cup.Walking became a chore.Every so often he’d say something about his past that raised eyebrows—that he once slept with $2 million under his pillow, for instance—but his employees shrugged the comments off as the medication-induced musings of a sick man.In early May 2015, a friend took him out in a wooden dory.His family in Florida had more complicated feelings.“It really just broke my heart when he disappeared,” said his sister, Elaine Schweinsberg.I felt so bad that his children had to grow up without him”.Both were ­eventually arrested—Ronald in Costa Rica in 1992, Raymond in Alaska in 2010—and handed long prison sentences.Despite being abandoned by their father, both believe he made the right choice.“I’m sure that he missed certain aspects of what was left behind.It’s like you cut a chunk of your heart out leaving.But things seldom end the way you visualize in life.You can only take your best shot and roll with the punches”.“It makes me admire the bastard even more”.“Reflecting on it now, it’s just what Australia’s all about,” said Norman Duke.“It’s all about redemption.All about finding a new life”.Spend long enough in Daintree, and you might also hear another story.As they neared a small bridge, they spotted a car in the ­crocodile-infested creek below.He dove into the creek, pulled out the unconscious man, and dragged him onto the bank.
