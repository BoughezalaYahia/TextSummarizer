The Traditional costing practices were pressurised by Cooper & Kaplan, (1984) due to the failure of providing detailed and quality information for decision making.The ABC system allocates the cost on the basis of cost drivers.Practically, there is a continuum between these two methods in a firm using them (Antos & Brimson, 1999).This paper is structured into three sections.The first section deals with the publication released on ABC costing since its inception to the present date.It also expands or criticises the theory provided by Kaplan and Johnson.The second section assesses the impact of ABC studies on the companies and consultants.It also discusses the perceived benefits provided by implementation of ABC system in organisations.The third section provides the conclusion.The section presents the literature and evaluation on the publications identifying the ABC techniques and its development.The relevant case study is also presented to provide the evidence of Researches.Initially, it was only a response by American scholars over incorrect standard costing methods.After the initial response, several scholars also provided their opinions.Lebas (1991) agreed that ABC has gained strategic and management dimensions.According to Bhimani (2007), there is rising interest in strategic management accounting (SMA).Under a firm, a SMA tool has the ability to link the strategic & marketing goals with the operational goals.Different practitioners & scholars are of their opinion that ABC system has various pitfalls.• Analysis of ABC model errors, such as errors in the estimation of model time.ABC designs are based on experiments and statistical system of the results.For example, the application of the processes of continual improvement to optimise the use of scarce resources of an organisation.The following illustrates the application of the ABC costing on the basis of information of the Peruvian company based in Frenosa.Frenosa is a manufacturing company, located in the industrial area, department of Lima Callao.Certification has earned him and strengthen the recognition and confidence to their local customers and from outside.Next, resources are typified into three categories: materials then, direct staff and other resources.• Select the cost objects: production activities and product liners clutch.If the answer is yes, then charged directly to the product.As an illustrative we can mention that the costs of materials are charged directly to the lining of clutch.A Budget can be described as a standard or a plan in financial terms.The budgets are prepared in order to control and measure the actual performance with the planned.ABB is derived from ABC and is related to zero-based budgeting.The development of activity based budgets will help senior executives and managers in exercising control through several ways.Strategic control and planning have become essential requirement due to the rising completion and variation in consumer demands.Under this system, the costs are apportioned to the products depending on the activities which are required for the production of these products.It further provides information regarding enhancement of production process, customer profitability analyses and pricing decision.The ABC has generated enormous enthusiasm in and around its basic ideas.Moreover, researchers are studying the actual cost accounting practices of companies.The ABC has correctly allocated cost by the use of multiple cost allocation bases.The ABC has stressed the idea that executives manage the costs to monitor activities instead of products.Accounting costs highlights the interdependent activities and trends between activities in many departments or functional areas.The ABC has stressed that the costs of production are affected by all functions in the value chain, not only by the manufacturing cost.Inventory costs provide incomplete production costs while taking decisions.That is, the case studies have shown that existing systems costs using large load averages.Many scholars and consultants have never tended to explore the history of thought.However, if they do, avoid leaning their versions of the history.If they do, should be especially careful to avoid claiming that their ideas are new.Influence in decisions relating to the fixed term pricing, product diversification and sale and manufacture thereof.Such simplified ignores other sources of information; other factors influence the pricing and numerous interdependencies and points between products and costs.More importantly, it also assures the achievement of the project by supporting in constructing a feeling of possession among the employees.Therefore, it is essential that the interviewer who might be a consultant from outside the company or is a member of the project team.It should be well educated and trained over handling various activities of departments including the areas of ABM and ABC.At the same time some scholars ignore the difficulties presented by such a method, which are neither few nor simple to solve.It is therefore inevitable to refer to the confusion causing the fact that a book with such misunderstanding of what are the costs has dissemination has been achieved e.g.Apart from that already given in the previous note, this change from the traditional method does not involve talk of a new method., features that do includes the ABC.
