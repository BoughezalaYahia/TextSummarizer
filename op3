Police in riot gear shot rubber bullets and used pepper spray on demonstrators — who call themselves water protectors — on the shoreline of the Cantapeta Creek, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation here on Wednesday.Demonstrators on the shoreline prayed, played drums, sang, and waded into the river towards the base of the hill where armed police stood.Schrode had joined others from the camp in solidarity as they prayed on the shoreline.A confrontation erupted after law enforcement dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site."I was shot in point blank range," said Schrode, who says she is shaken but physically will recover."Another water protector was also shot at twice at point blank range, but the rubber bullet hit the water, and not him".Even as law enforcement warned protesters to leave the area and return to their camp, demonstrators could be heard yelling back at police."There was absolutely no provocation of any kind," said film director Josh Fox, who was also on scene."The police pepper sprayed people sitting in the water"."I was facing the line of officers from across the river and all of a sudden, I felt as if someone swung a mallet with all their might against my lower back.It obliterated me," said Schrode."I turned around and I had no idea what just happened.And there was an officer pointing his gun in my direction from a boat".The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has sued the Army Corps of Engineers for not consulting them on the route of the pipeline."[President] Barack Obama said we can wait a few weeks.
