A major change that has occurred in the Western family is an increased incidence in divorce.Whereas in the past, divorce was a relatively rare occurrence, in recent times it has become quite commonplace.This change is borne out clearly in census figures.45).An important issue for sociologists, and indeed for all of society, is why these changes in marital patterns have occurred.It will be argued that the best explanations are to be found within a broad socio-economic framework.One type of explanation for rising divorce has focused on changes in laws relating to marriage.It is possible, they claim, that there has always been a degree of marital instability.301).Bilton et al.therefore believe that changes in divorce rates can be best explained in terms of changes in the legal system.The problem with this type of explanation however, is that it does not consider why these laws have changed in the first place.Another type of explanation is one that focuses precisely on these broad societal changes.Women as a result have been forced to become both homemakers and economic providers.According to Hart, the contradiction of these two roles has lead to conflict and this is the main cause of marital breakdown.Bilton et al.(1995) offer a legal explanation and hence would see the solutions also being determined in this domain.Indeed it would seem to be a solution directed more at symptoms than addressing fundamental causes.In those cases where violence is involved, the consequences could be tragic.(Harrison, 1990).It is difficult to know however, how such an analysis might be translated into practical social policies.This is because the Hart program would appear to require in the first place a radical restructuring of the economic system.Whilst this may be desirable for some, it is not achievable in the present political climate.This situation suggests then that social policies need to be geared to providing support and security for these types of families.
