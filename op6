Corruption free government is not a necessary condition for rapid economic development.If the corporate and institutions work and uncertainty is checked, progress is possible.-S.Transparency International publishes every year lists ranking corruption in various countries.This list is neither complete nor exhaustive.Saddam Hussein and his cronies might have skimmed more than some of the above rulers.Now the point of discussion is: Why do some corrupt regimes do very well and others badly?The achievements during the period had remained impressive and remarkable.If we look at transparency international\'s list of 133 countries ranked.In order of corruption, we will find that the well-off western countries all figure in the top of 35.1) and the USA comes a bit lower at 18.Paradoxically, some of the poorer countries are also among the most corrupt and some of the less corrupt are progressing.Again it is difficult to find any correlation between corruption and economic growth.Some of the fastest growing countries in the world are also in the bottom half of the corruption list.Corruption in long run may destroy the whole society morally, ethically and economically.Italy, the most corrupt country in Western Europe, has been one of the fastest growing economies.The puzzle to ponder is why does corruption coexist with both good and bad economic performance?Why has India over the decades grown more slowly than Indonesia despite less corruption?A survey conducted for World Development Report some years ago, find one answer.Businessmen in surveyed countries said that the main problem with corruption was that it increases risks and uncertainties.The risks declined dramatically, if corruption produced reliable outcome (as in Indonesia).This happens when there is much discretion in decision making.It also happens when some decision makers are corrupt and others are not.India is such a country where entrepreneurs are not sure of the things, some decision makers are corrupt and others are honest.Arbitrariness in decisions, unreason ability of demands makes the business wary of dealing in such cases.In this lexicon, Suharto was both honest and sane and delivered the goods.Finally, the quality of institutions seems to be the most important factor for the growth of a country.If the institutions work even moderately well, progress is possible even if money is skimmed off at the top.But if the institutions are incapable of enforcing any rights, corruption will hasten economic collapse.In brief, it can well be concluded that corruption and economic growth has no clear correlation.
